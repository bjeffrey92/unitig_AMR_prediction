# unitig_AMR_prediction
Research code for developing graph-based methods to predict bacterial phenotype from whole genome sequence data.

Inspired by the success of graph-based approaches to machine learning in other fields, the purpose of this project is to develop methods for inferring phenotype from a graph representation of the bacterial pangenome.
